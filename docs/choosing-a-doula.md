# How to Choose a Doula in Metro Detroit

Finding the right doula shouldn’t feel like a scavenger hunt. This guide gives you a simple, culturally-rooted process to locate and vet Black doulas across Metro Detroit.

> **Shortcut:** Browse the community-vetted directory: [Find Black Doulas →](https://theblknest.org/?q=doula&near=Detroit%2C%20MI)

---

## What a Doula Does (and Doesn’t)
- **Birth doula:** Prepares you for labor, supports you during birth, advocates for your preferences.
- **Postpartum doula:** Supports recovery, newborn care, feeding, sleep, and household transitions.
- **They don’t replace medical care.** Doulas provide emotional, informational, and physical support—not clinical care.

## Step-by-Step: Find + Vet Your Doula
1. **Search locally**  
   Use filters for *city/ZIP*, *virtual vs. in-person*, *languages*, and *insurance/Medicaid/self-pay*.
2. **Check experience fit**  
   Settings (hospital, center, home), specialties (VBAC, multiples, high-risk, trauma-informed).
3. **Cultural concordance matters**  
   Prioritize doulas embedded in Detroit’s Black birthwork community.
4. **Interview 2–3 doulas** (30–45 min each)  
   Compare notes right after.

---

## Interview Questions (Copy/Paste)
- Availability & backup coverage for your due window  
- Support approach in hospital settings; advocacy style  
- Local relationships with L&D units and midwifery practices  
- Inclusion practices; experience with diverse family structures  
- Lactation support scope & referrals  
- What’s included vs. add-ons; emergency scenarios; fees/sliding scale

---

## Budgeting & Payment
- **Typical packages**: prenatals + birth + 1–2 postpartum visits.  
- Ask about **sliding scale**, **payment plans**, and any **community funds**.  
- **Insurance/Medicaid** pilots exist—confirm in writing.

> Tip: Popular doulas book 2–4 months ahead.

---

## Red Flags
- Outcome guarantees  
- Dismissive of your preferences/culture  
- No written agreement or unclear backup

---

## Preparing to Work Together
- **Birth preferences worksheet**  
- **Support team roles** (partner, doula, family)  
- **Hospital policies** (visitors, induction/C-section protocols)
