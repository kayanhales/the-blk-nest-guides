# Start Here

If you’re 

- black & pregnant
- black & postpartum
- black & parenting 
- parenting a black child
    
and feeling overwhelmed — you’re in the right place.

This section will help you understand how to use this guide and set expectations for what’s ahead.

## You can use this guide to:
 
- Learn about **resources and services** you didn’t know existed  
- Find **support spaces** that feel culturally safe  
- Put words to feelings you haven’t been able to name yet  
- Figure out what kind of help might actually help *you*

Some sections may resonate deeply.  
Others may not apply to you right now — and that’s okay.

## How the Guide Is Organized

The guide is organized by **life phase and type of support**, not by trends or timelines.

You’ll find sections for:

- Pregnancy
- Birth and postpartum realities
- Support and community
- Care and healing
- Resources and services
- Parenting beyond the newborn stage

Each section is meant to stand on its own. You can jump around freely.

## Why This Guide Has a Black Lens

Black parents face unique realities, medically, culturally, and socially.

We are more likely to:

- Have our pain minimized
- Receive less information about available care
- Be expected to “push through” instead of being supported
- Be praised for strength instead of offered rest

This guide centers Black experiences **without centering fear**.

It highlights care paths, language, and resources that many of us only discover after struggling, often because someone else finally told us they existed.

We believe information should not be gatekept.

## What This Guide Is, and Is Not

**This guide is:**

- Honest
- Calm
- Practical
- Grounded in lived experience
- Meant to be revisited as your needs change

**This guide is not:**

- Medical advice
- A replacement for professional care
- A checklist you must complete
- A judgment of how you parent


## A Gentle Reality Check

Parenthood, especially motherhood, is beautiful.  
Parenthood, especially motherhood, is also hard.  

Both can be true — especially for Black parents.

This guide exists because many of us enter pregnancy and parenthood with love, faith, and excitement, but without clear information about what life can actually feel like on the other side.

This is not meant to scare you.  
It’s meant to ground you.
