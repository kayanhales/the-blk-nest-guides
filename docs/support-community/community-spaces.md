# Community Spaces

Community spaces offer support that appointments often don’t.

These are places designed for connection, not rushing or fixing.

## What Community Spaces Provide

Many community spaces offer:
- Emotional support
- Shared experience
- Education
- Gentle accountability
- Relief from isolation

They are especially important during pregnancy and postpartum, when support often drops off.
