# How to Show Up and Ask for Help

If you are overwhelmed, exhausted, or stretched thin, you do not need a mindset shift.
You need **support you can actually access**.

This page is about *how* to ask — not why you should.

## Step 1: Identify What Kind of Help You Need

You don’t need perfect clarity. Pick the closest match.

**Emotional support**

- Someone to listen
- A support group
- A therapist
- A postpartum support space

**Physical support**

- Help with the baby
- Help overnight
- Help with meals
- Help with household tasks

**Information support**

- Understanding postpartum symptoms
- Learning about available services
- Help navigating benefits or care options

If everything feels overwhelming, start with **emotional support**.

## Step 2: Use Short, Direct Language

You do not need to explain your whole situation.

Use one sentence.

### Examples you can copy:

- “I’m overwhelmed and need support.”
- “I’m not okay and need help finding resources.”
- “Do you know any postpartum support groups?”
- “I need help during the day / overnight.”
- “Can you help me figure out next steps?”

That is enough information to start.

## Step 3: Decide *Where* to Ask

Choose one place. Not all of them.

**For emotional support**

- Postpartum support groups
- Community spaces
- A therapist
- A trusted friend

**For physical help**

- Partner
- Family member
- Postpartum doula
- Night support / newborn doula

**For guidance**

- Community organizations
- Lactation consultants
- Postpartum care providers
- WIC or local maternal health orgs

If one option doesn’t work, move to the next.

## Step 4: Lower the Bar for Showing Up

You do NOT need to:

- Be prepared
- Share your story
- Speak the whole time
- Stay the full session

You CAN:

- Join late
- Leave early
- Listen only
- Say “I’m just here today”

Showing up once counts.

## Step 5: If You’re Asking Someone You Know

Be specific. Vague requests often don’t get met.

Instead of:

- “I need help”

Try:

- “Can you watch the baby for one hour?”
- “Can you bring a meal this week?”
- “Can you sit with me while I rest?”
- “Can you help me find postpartum resources?”

Specific asks are easier to respond to.

---

## Step 6: If Help Feels Hard to Ask For

This usually means:

- You’ve been the strong one
- You’re used to managing alone
- You don’t want to be a burden

None of that means you don’t need help.
It means you’ve been carrying too much.

---

## Step 7: Set Boundaries Early

Getting help does NOT mean:

- Taking advice you didn’t ask for
- Staying in spaces that feel unsafe
- Explaining your choices repeatedly

You are allowed to say:

- “That’s not helpful for me.”
- “I’m not looking for advice right now.”
- “This space isn’t a good fit.”

You can leave and try something else.

## If You Don’t Know Where to Start

Start here:

- One support group
- One community space
- One conversation

Support is not something you earn.
It is something you access.

That is the goal.
